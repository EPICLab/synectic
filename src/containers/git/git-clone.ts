/**
 * Clone a repository into a new directory.
 * 
 * @param obj - A destructured object for named parameters.
 * @param obj.dir - The worktree root directory.
 * @param obj.repo - The URL of a remote repository, or the path to a local repository.
 * @param obj.branch - Instead of pointing the newly created HEAD to the branch pointed to by the cloned repository's
 * HEAD, point to this branch name or SHA-1 instead. In a non-bare repository, this is the branch that will be checked out.
 * @param obj.bare - Make a `bare` Git repsoitory. That is, instead of creating a directory and placing the administrative
 * files in the `.git` sub-directory, make the directory itself the `$GIT_DIR`. This implies `--no-checkout` because there 
 * is nowhere to check out the working tree. Also the branch heads at the remote are copied directly to corresponding local
 * branch heads, without mapping them to `refs/remotes/origin/`. When this option is used, neither remote-tracking branches 
 * nor the related configuration variables are created.
 * @param obj.singleBranch - Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single branch, either specified by the `--branch` 
 * option or the primary branch remoteâ€™s HEAD points at. Further fetches into the resulting repository will only update the 
 * remote-tracking branch for the branch this option was used for the initial cloning. If the HEAD at the remote did not point 
 * at any branch when `singleBranch` clone was made, no remote-tracking branch is created.
 * @param obj.noCheckout - No checkout of HEAD is performed after the clone is complete.
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} A Promise object containing a boolean indicating whether the clone operation succeeded.
